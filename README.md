# AndroidIDE_File_Creator


It makes files that are very similar to Android Studio files when created, a very cool feature to be honest, and yes, perhaps this will be added to AndroidIde




### Usage:
Open your AndroidIDE and go to the terminal or you can do it anywhere in the AndroydIDE termux and MT manager run the command Cd Or clone git 


For the team Cd You will need to unzip the zip file into a directory and use the command source or w to launch it, no changes to mods without root, etc.


Example:
```
cd /path/to/sh/script

# You Can use source 

sh CreatorV2.sh
```





To use commands via Git you will need either Termux or Android Ide, install Git as shown here 
```
pkg install git
```


Afterwards you need to install the repo in home 

```
cd $Home
git clone htpps/link/to/git
```
After this you need to run the script use Cd To move to the folder that Git downloaded
```
cd /example_git_clone/
```
Use source or sh to run the script like this 



Source
```
source ex.sh
```


Sh
```
sh ex.sh
```
### script part

what about the script part, yes, now Iâ€™ll show you what and how






the first thing you will encounter is selecting a folder (directory). The script will basically explain that if you press enter, the files will be saved in the current directory. To avoid this, specify the directory, but there should be no spaces or other symbols, but the script will give an error.
